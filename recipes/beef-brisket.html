        <p class="centre">Not only is this apple and onion smothered beef brisket easy and delicious, it's also very fast (for a brisket recipe)! <br> Cooking it low and slow often results in dried-out meat, so instead we dial up the temperature slightly and bake it in about half the time to ensure it's both tender and moist.</p>

                <li>1 large yellow onion, sliced</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <div class="recipe-card-section">
            <ol>
                <li>Season both sides of the brisket generously with salt, pepper, and cayenne. For best results, place brisket over an aluminum foil "rack" set over a plate and refrigerate, uncovered, 8 to 12 hours. </li>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).  </li>
                <li>Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and salt. Cook and stir until translucent, about 5 minutes. <br> Stir in garlic, rosemary, and apple juice. Increase heat to high and boil until liquid is reduced by about half, about 3 minutes.  </li>
                <li>Transfer half of the apple-onion mixture into a baking dish. Place brisket fat-side up on top; cover with remaining apple-onion mixture. Cover baking dish tightly with foil.  </li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour 30 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 250 degrees F (121 degrees C) and bake until fork-tender, about 2 hours 15 minutes. Check for doneness after 2 hours.</li>
                <li>Transfer brisket to a plate and tent with foil.  </li>
                <li>Pour the onions and braising liquid into a large measuring cup or bowl. Skim some fat off the top. Puree with a stick blender to create a gravy. </li>
                <li>Slice brisket across the grain and serve with the gravy. </li>
                <li><strong>Enjoy!</strong></li>
